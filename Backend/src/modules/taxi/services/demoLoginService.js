/**
 * Phones that log in with a fixed OTP, for app-store review and for testing.
 *
 * Configured as `DEMO_LOGIN_PHONES=9000000001:1234,8000000002:1234`. Read by
 * both the rider and the driver login, so one number can be handed to a
 * reviewer who needs to open both apps without receiving an SMS.
 *
 * This exists because `STATIC_OTP_PHONE`/`STATIC_OTP_CODE` hold exactly one
 * number between the two apps: using it for a review account took away the
 * team's own test number.
 *
 * Only ever an addition - a phone not listed here gets a real OTP as before,
 * and an empty or malformed setting leaves every login untouched.
